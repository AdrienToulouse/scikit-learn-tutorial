# Case Study - Text classification for SMS spam detection


We first load the text data from the `dataset` directory that should be located in your notebooks directory, which we created by running the `fetch_data.py` script from the top level of the GitHub repository.

Furthermore, we perform some simple preprocessing and split the data array into two parts:

1. `text`: A list of lists, where each sublists contains the contents of our emails
2. `y`: our SPAM vs HAM labels stored in binary; a 1 represents a spam message, and a 0 represnts a ham (non-spam) message. 

```python
import os

with open(os.path.join("datasets", "smsspam", "SMSSpamCollection")) as f:
    lines = [line.strip().split("\t") for line in f.readlines()]

text = [x[1] for x in lines]
y = [int(x[0] == "spam") for x in lines]
```

```python
text[:10]
```

```python
y[:10]
```

```python
print('Number of ham and spam messages:', np.bincount(y))
```

```python
type(text)
```

```python
type(y)
```

Next, we split our dataset into 2 parts, the test and training dataset:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

text_train, text_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(text, y, 
                                                          random_state=42,
                                                          test_size=0.25,
                                                          stratify=y)
```

Now, we use the CountVectorizer to parse the text data into a bag-of-words model.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

print('CountVectorizer defaults')
CountVectorizer()
```

```python
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
vectorizer.fit(text_train)

X_train = vectorizer.transform(text_train)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(text_test)
```

```python
print(len(vectorizer.vocabulary_))
```

```python
X_train.shape
```

```python
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names()[:20])
```

```python
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names()[2000:2020])
```

```python
print(X_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
```

### Training a Classifier on Text Features


We can now train a classifier, for instance a logistic regression classifier, which is a fast baseline for text classification tasks:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

clf = LogisticRegression()
clf
```

```python
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

We can now evaluate the classifier on the testing set. Let's first use the built-in score function, which is the rate of correct classification in the test set:

```python
clf.score(X_test, y_test)
```

We can also compute the score on the training set to see how well we do there:

```python
clf.score(X_train, y_train)
```

# Visualizing important features

```python
def visualize_coefficients(classifier, feature_names, n_top_features=25):
    # get coefficients with large absolute values 
    coef = classifier.coef_.ravel()
    positive_coefficients = np.argsort(coef)[-n_top_features:]
    negative_coefficients = np.argsort(coef)[:n_top_features]
    interesting_coefficients = np.hstack([negative_coefficients, positive_coefficients])
    # plot them
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
    colors = ["tab:orange" if c < 0 else "tab:blue" for c in coef[interesting_coefficients]]
    plt.bar(np.arange(2 * n_top_features), coef[interesting_coefficients], color=colors)
    feature_names = np.array(feature_names)
    plt.xticks(np.arange(1, 2 * n_top_features + 1), feature_names[interesting_coefficients], rotation=60, ha="right");
```

```python
visualize_coefficients(clf, vectorizer.get_feature_names())
```

```python
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(min_df=2)
vectorizer.fit(text_train)

X_train = vectorizer.transform(text_train)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(text_test)

clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(clf.score(X_train, y_train))
print(clf.score(X_test, y_test))
```

```python
len(vectorizer.get_feature_names())
```

```python
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names()[:20])
```

```python
visualize_coefficients(clf, vectorizer.get_feature_names())
```

      <li>
      Use TfidfVectorizer instead of CountVectorizer. Are the results better? How are the coefficients different?
